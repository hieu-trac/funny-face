# Funny Face
## Overview
A sample ARKit and RealityKit app written using SwiftUI. Choose among several different looks including:
* Fancy Hat
* Speech Bubble
* Eyeball
* Glasses
* Food
* Mustache
* Robot
* Combo 1 (Fancy Hat, Glasses, and Mustache)
* Combo 2 (Robot and Food)

You can cycle between these different looks using the on screen arrow buttons. Thereâ€™s also a camera capture button you can use to take a snapshot of the current view.

## Interesting Tidbits
1. The Eyeball prop will move with your own eye movement.
2. The Mustache prop will wiggle if you smile.
3. The Robot prop will blink and move the jaw in coordination with your own movement. If you do a surprised smile the Robot prop will show sparks, make a sound, and make the eyes glow red.
